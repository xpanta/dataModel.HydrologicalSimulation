### List of data models

The following entity types are available:
- [Basin](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.OpenChannelManagement/blob/master/Basin/README.md). This entity contains a harmonised description of a generic basin entity, which represents the main component of the model. Its principal purpose is to convert atmospheric conditions into streamflow at specific locations in the watershed.
- [ClarkUnitStand](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.OpenChannelManagement/blob/master/ClarkUnitStand/README.md). This entity contains a harmonised description of ClarkUnitStandard entity, which describes the standard synthetic Clark Unit Hydrograph method (it produces a unit hydrograph that theoretically has an infinite number of ordinates). It is associated with the Subasin entity. 
- [Curve](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.OpenChannelManagement/blob/master/Curve/README.md). This entity contains a harmonised description of a generic curve made for Hydrologic Simulation model. 
- [GriddedDataset](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.OpenChannelManagement/blob/master/GriddedDataset/README.md). Is a harmonized description of an entity containing information in a normal grid.
- [GriddedVariable](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.OpenChannelManagement/blob/master/GriddedVariable/README.md). This entity is a harmonized description of the variable of the gridded file
- [Junction](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.OpenChannelManagement/blob/master/Junction/README.md). This entity contains a harmonised description of a junction entity, which describes an element with one or more inflows and only one outflow.
- [LagMethod](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.OpenChannelManagement/blob/master/LagMethod/README.md). This entity contains a harmonised description of the lag entity, which describes the lag routing method that represents the translation of the flood waves. It is associated with the reach entity. 
- [LinearReservoirMethod](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.OpenChannelManagement/blob/master/LinearReservoirMethod/README.md). This entity contains a harmonised description of the linear reservoir entity, which describes the linear reservoir baseflow method. This method assumes a linear reservoir to model the recession of baseflow after a storm event. It is associated with the Subasin entity. 
- [MeteorologyModel](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.OpenChannelManagement/blob/master/MeteorologyModel/README.md). This entity contains a harmonised description of a Meteorology model for a basin.
- [Reach](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.OpenChannelManagement/blob/master/Reach/README.md). This entity contains a harmonised description of a reach entity, which describes an element with one or more inflows and only one outflow. 
- [SimpleCanopy](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.OpenChannelManagement/blob/master/SimpleCanopy/README.md). This entity contains a harmonised description of the simple canopy entity, which describes the method used to represent the plant canopy of the basin. It is associated with the Subasin entity. 
- [SimpleSurface](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.OpenChannelManagement/blob/master/SimpleSurface/README.md). This entity contains a harmonised description of the simple surface method which describes the method used to represent the soil surface of the basin. It is associated with the Subasin entity.  
- [Sink](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.OpenChannelManagement/blob/master/Sink/README.md). This entity contains a harmonised description of a generic sink, which describes a sink with one or more inflows but no outflow.
- [SMAloss](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.OpenChannelManagement/blob/master/SMAloss/README.md). This entity contains a harmonised description of soil moisture accounting (SMA) loss method used to simulate the movement of the water through the soil and towards the exit of the subbasin. It is associated with the Subasin entity. 
- [Subbasin](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.OpenChannelManagement/blob/master/Subbasin/README.md). This entity contains a harmonised description of a generic subbasin, which represents an element with no inflow and one outflow. 
- [TSGage](https://github.com/smart-data-models/dataModel.OpenChannelManagement/blob/master/TSGage/README.md). This entity contains a harmonised description of a generic gage (time series object) for Hydrologic Simulation model.
